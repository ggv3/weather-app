# My solution for a coding test

Application for fetching weather forecast for next 12 hours based on the browsers location data

## Technologies

### Frontend

-   React
-   Axios

### Backend

-   Nodejs
-   Koa

## Installation

You need to setup `.env` file inside `/backend` folder where you need to store your OpenWeatherMap `APPID`

Run `docker-compose build` and `docker-compose-up` to get the app running.

If you're not comfortable using Docker just run `npm install && npm start` inside both `/backend` and `/frontend` folders to run the app locally.
